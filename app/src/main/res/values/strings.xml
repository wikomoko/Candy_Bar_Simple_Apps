The origin of lollipops is thought to have come from the way ancient humans collected honey using sticks. They then consume the honey that has been collected directly from the stick. The forerunner of a more modern lollipop is thought to have been found in the Arab, Chinese, and Ancient Egyptian cultures. At that time, their people made candyby mixing fruits or nuts with honey and then stabbed with a stalk to make it easier to enjoy.</string>
